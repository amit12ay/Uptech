                    Plumbing is any system that conveys fluids for a wide range
                    of applications. Plumbing uses pipes, valves, plumbing
                    fixtures, tanks, and other apparatuses to convey fluids.

                    Water treatmentâ€”Conventional water treatment involves four
                    processes: coagulation, clarification, filtration, and
                    disinfection. Beyond this, advanced purification techniques
                    like activated carbon, reverse osmosis, and advanced
                    oxidation processes should be applied.
